![screenshot](https://github.com/ahisky/xplore/blob/master/etc/Screen.gif)

This is a fork of the original Xplore, currently with minor edits.
It is forked to ensure that it's codes are safe in a permanent place, and that it is also usable on modern systems.

### How to build

Please refer to the `INSTALL` file for more information.

```
$ xmkmf -a
$ make
$ su
Password :
# make install
# make install.man
# exit
$
```

It is tested to build and run on Trisquel GNU/Linux 9.0 Etiona.
